# K-Fold Training Implementation
# This is a placeholder file for v2 functionality
# 
# The actual implementation from PR #11 includes:
# - K-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation
# - Mixed precision training support
# - Integration with NeuroSnake architecture
# - Clinical-grade validation framework
#
# To get the complete implementation:
# 1. Merge PR #11 into main
# 2. Or download from branch: phoenix-protocol-sota-upgrade-13225564203933682807
#
# Expected functionality:
# - Stratified k-fold splitting
# - Per-fold training and validation
# - Aggregated metrics across folds
# - Model ensemble options
