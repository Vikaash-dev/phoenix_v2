# LLM Context & Analysis

This directory contains automated analysis and context files generated to help Large Language Models understand the Phoenix Mamba V2 codebase.

## Contents

- **[brain-tumor-context.json](./brain-tumor-context.json)**: A machine-readable index of key files, models, and configurations. Use this to quickly load the project structure.
- **[llm_analysis.md](./llm_analysis.md)**: A deep, line-by-line commentary on the codebase, highlighting architectural decisions, code smells, security notes, and open research questions.

## Usage

When starting a new session with an LLM:
1.  Read `brain-tumor-context.json` to understand the file structure.
2.  Read `llm_analysis.md` to get up to speed on the current state, limitations, and next steps.
