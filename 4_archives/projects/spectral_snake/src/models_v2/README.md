# Models v2

This module contains the new, modular components for the Disentangled VAE.

## Cross-Analysis

This new, modular architecture is a significant improvement over the previous monolithic `DisentangledVAE`. By breaking down the monolith into separate, reusable components, we make the codebase more flexible, more maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Improvements

- **Modularity**: The `DisentangledVAE` has been broken down into a set of clean, reusable components.
- **Flexibility**: The new, modular architecture makes it easy to swap out components and experiment with different architectures.
- **Maintainability**: The new, modular architecture is easier to understand and maintain than the previous monolithic architecture.

## Areas to Improve

- **Unit Tests**: We need to write a full suite of unit tests for the new, modular components.
- **Benchmarking**: We need to benchmark the performance of the new, modular components and optimize them for speed.
- **Documentation**: We need to write more detailed documentation for the new, modular components.
