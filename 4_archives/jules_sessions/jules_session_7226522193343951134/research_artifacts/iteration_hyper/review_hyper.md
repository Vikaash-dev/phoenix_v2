# Automated Peer Review (Hyper-Liquid Iteration)

## 1. Summary
The paper proposes "Hyper-Liquid Snake", an extension of Liquid Neural Networks where the time-constant parameters are generated by a hypernetwork conditioned on the input image.

## 2. Strengths
*   **Concept:** The idea of "Adaptive Dynamics" (input-dependent ODE parameters) is theoretically very pleasing and addresses a known limitation of Neural ODEs (stiffness vs. efficiency).
*   **Architecture:** The implementation of the Hyper-Controller using GAP+MLP is efficient and doesn't add massive overhead.
*   **Results:** The contrast robustness curve clearly demonstrates the benefit of the approach.

## 3. Weaknesses
*   **Stability:** Dynamically generating $\tau$ can lead to instability if $\tau$ becomes too small (exploding gradients). The authors mention "scaling" in the code, but the paper should elaborate on constraints.
*   **Complexity:** We are now stacking Snake Convs, ODE solvers, and Hypernetworks. Is the model becoming over-engineered?

## 4. Decision
**Score:** 8 (Accept)
**Decision:** Accept

This is a smart evolution of the Liquid-Snake concept. It adds a "Meta" layer to the "Causal" layer.
