### Methods of Data Augmentation [...] ### Data Enrichment for Brain Tumor Identification

In deep learning, data augmentation is an essential strategy, especially in fields like medical imaging, where gathering diverse and huge datasets can be difficult. Before applying the augmentation, images have been enhanced using noise removal and contrast enhancement, and the enhanced image is shown in Figure 1. [...] The Data Augmentation was only used on both classes, especially on the minority (non-tumor) class, by using geometric transformations like random rotation, flipping, zooming, and contrast change, contributing to higher intra-class variability. Non-tumor images were generated as synthetic using repeated applications and controlled transformations to generate more samples of images retaining the image’s properties. This action had enlarged the representation of the minority class, but not through unrealistic artifacts. To further balance the training dataset, oversampling was applied, effectively decreasing the odds of being imbalanced by copying non-tumor samples until an almost similar representation of both classes in the training set.",0.9997305,

The model was trained with the AdaMax algorithmic optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, achieving a remarkable training loss of 0.0018. This demonstrates the model’s efficient pattern learning and strong convergence during training. We assessed the model’s performance on a separate testing data set to ensure robustness, verifying its generalization capabilities. Combining a well-curated data set, efficient optimizer and appropriate loss function has resulted in a promising brain tumor detection model with potential applications in real-world medical scenarios. [...] 4. Batch normalization: Batch normalization is a powerful technique in deep learning that enhances training by normalizing the activation functions of each layer. It mitigates the internal covariate shift problem, improving convergence and optimization. Batch normalization enables higher learning rates, leading to faster training and better performance. It acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting, and reduces the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. This technique is a standard component in modern deep learning architectures, contributing to the success of training deep neural networks on complex tasks. [...] 1. Data preprocessing: Before model building, medical images undergo preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization and data augmentation. Image resizing ensures uniform size, simplifying computational requirements and enabling efficient data processing. Normalization scales pixel values to a standardized range (typically 0 to 1), reducing the impact of intensity variations. Data augmentation expands the training data set using transformations such as rotations, flips and brightness adjustments, improving the model’s generalization and robustness to varying conditions.",0.99963164,

These augmentations emulate changes found in real data, improving the model’s performance on data that it has not previously encountered. Additionally, all images were set to a uniform input size of 608 × 608 pixels. This standardization improves consistency and ensures the preservation of essential details required for precise tumor detection.

Customized anchor boxes, generated through k-means clustering on the training data, facilitated the accurate localization of bounding boxes. The IoU threshold of 0.5 was employed to establish valid detections, effectively balancing sensitivity and specificity in tumor detection. [...] We used YOLOv7’s default ComputeLoss function, which combines CIoU loss for bounding box accuracy, objectness loss to detect tumor presence, and classification loss for tumor type.
