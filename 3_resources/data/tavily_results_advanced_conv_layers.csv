However, conventional convolution is not sufficiently sensitive to elongated local structures in medical images. For this reason, dynamic snake convolution (DSC)  was incorporated into our model. Therefore, we extended this convolution to three-dimensional space and optimized it to better adapt to our architecture. Originally designed to improve the segmentation accuracy and efficiency of complex and variable fine features, such as blood vessels and roads, dynamic snake convolution focuses adaptively on slender and intricate local structures. This enables the precise extraction of tubular and complex patterns. In this study, MRI images of the human brain, especially in the cerebellum, exhibited [...] As shown in Figure 5, dynamic snake convolution is based on the ideas of dynamic convolution and deformable kernel convolution [24,25].

[...] To enhance the flexibility of the convolution kernel and enable it to capture the complex geometric features of the target, dynamic snake convolution introduces a deformable offset, denoted as Δ. However, when dealing with elongated structures, allowing the model complete freedom to learn the deformable offsets can cause the receptive field to deviate from the target. This issue is addressed by employing an iterative strategy, as shown in Figure 5.

By dynamically adjusting the offset, convolution, and sampling locations, a deformable convolutional network (DCN) is capable of robust object identification, even under geometric transformations, such as variations in size, posture, and viewpoint. [...] To mitigate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model, we first employed data augmentation techniques to generate a diverse set of MR images with varying intensity levels, facilitating more robust tumor detection and classification. In the next phase, we introduced a self-attention module integrated into a deformable convolutional network (DCN) architecture, drawing inspiration from the work of Dai et al.27. This technique leverages visual attention mechanisms to extract distinctive image attributes, enhancing model performance with minimal computational overhead. By analyzing the interconnections between convolutional features while incorporating spatial context, our approach significantly refines feature extraction for brain tumor classification. [...] The attention mechanism operates across three levels of feature representation to capture details at different scales: (1) low-level features, which encode general intensity patterns and fundamental texture information; (2) mid-level features, which extract structural representations such as the shape and spatial coherence of tumors; and (3) high-level features, which focus on the semantic understanding of tumor morphologies and abnormalities in cerebral tissue.

Suppose, is a sampling grid for the regular convolution. For each location on the input feature map and location in the sampling grid, an additional convolutional layer, typically with kernel of the same size and dilation, predicts an offset . Then the sampling grid for deformable convolution is augmented with predicted offsets, and kernel is applied to the values at locations , which are computed via bilinear interpolation, since the obtained locations can be fractional. The final value, computed by deformable convolution at a point is , where are weights of the convolution kernel, instead of in the case of standard one. [...] Insertion of deformable convolution layers in VoxResNet architecture yield statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy for imagery without preprocessing and skull-stripping of images. However, they do not improve classification performance on preprocessed data. This can be possibly explained by the fact that MNI normalization significantly reduces variability in small deformations of the brain image and deformable convolutions lack information for training the meaningful offset. But at the same time the number of trainable parameters increases, making the model with deformable convolutions less stable to overfitting. [...] Thus, convolutional networks can be applied directly to the raw neuroimaging data without loss of model performance and over-fitting, which allows skipping the feature extraction step.

However, there is a problem: the traditional convolutional networks are very sensitive to image size, scale and spatial orientation thus require thorough pre-processing specific to a clinical application.
